# Boop

Embed onchain actions anywhere — swap, tip, or mint directly from X posts or blogs.

O

nchain actions are often buried behind too many steps, especially in social and content environments:

    Users must click a link, open a new tab, wait for dapp load, connect a wallet, switch chains, and then finally complete an action.
    This creates friction, confusion, and high drop-off — especially on mobile or when trying to onboard new users.
    Developers can't easily bring onchain functionality to where users already are — like Twitter (X) or inside existing websites.

✅ Solution

Boop makes onchain actions instantly accessible and natively embeddable.

    Users can mint, tip, or swap tokens directly from a tweet, blog post, or any webpage — without ever needing to open a separate app.
    With just one step (enabling the Boop browser extension), the user experience becomes frictionless and contextual.

💡 Examples

    Swap via 1inch in an X Post
    A project shares a tweet: "Support our token launch — swap ETH for $TOKEN directly below 👇"
    With Boop, that tweet becomes a live, interactive embed where users can swap via 1inch directly — no new tabs, no connect steps.

    Social selling, simplified. Boop lets you create ecommerce links, accept multi-chain USDC, and consolidate payments to one chain with CCTP V2.

📦 What is Boop, exactly?

Boop is a browser extension + embed framework that brings onchain actions to the platforms where users already are — like X, websites, or anywhere you can paste a link or embed a widget.

Think of it as the "magic layer" that turns passive content into an interactive dapp.

With Boop:

    Devs can embed mint, tip, or swap functionality anywhere
    Users only need to install the Boop extension once

🔗 Key Use Cases

    Let people mint NFTs directly from a tweet
    Let creators receive tips in any token, multichain
    Let users swap tokens directly from a blog post
    Let brands run promotions or campaigns that trigger onchain rewards instantly from content

🌐 Why Boop Matters

Boop unlocks a new UX primitive:

    "Act onchain wherever you already are."

Instead of dragging users to a dapp, Boop brings the dapp to the user — in 2 steps, not 5

This changes the game for:

    User onboarding
    Onchain distribution
    Onchain tipping/funding
    Integrating blockchain into everyday content experiences
